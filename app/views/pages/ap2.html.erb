          Biot’s history dates back to the Roman Empire when it was officially mentioned for the first   
          time. And even now, one cannot fail to recognise that the history of the old village ("le vieux 
          village") has been quite agitated. Today, this historic centre provides a perfect setting for 
          typical village life in the south of France and thus is a popular place for tourists. 
          Nonetheless, Biot 
          has been able to retain its individuality and authenticity which is reflected in its narrow
          streets, cobbled roads and many other hidden charms. That is probably the reason why the famous  
          tourist guide 
          Michelin nominated Biot as one of the nicest "Detours de France".

<h2>Biot’s unique location in the heart of the Côte d’Azur </h2>

<div class="row">
 <div class="span3">

Biot can be found nested in the triangle made up of Cannes, Nice and Grasse. And, because of its proximity to the sea, it makes an ideal location for a beach holdiday. Within a half-hour drive, you can easily visit Grasse, the city of perfumes; Cannes, the city of festivals; and Nice, the administrative centre of the “Alpes-Maritimes”. And don’t forget the Roman city of Antibes, only 6 km away, where you can explore Europe’s biggest yacht harbour.
